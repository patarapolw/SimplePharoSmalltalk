My first exposure to [Pharo Smalltalk](http://pharo.org) and [GNU Smalltalk](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual/html_node/Tutorial.html).

## What is Smalltalk

Smalltalk is a family of probably as purest Object-Oriented Programming language, according to Richard Kenneth Eng. [What is Smalltalk?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Smalltalk)

Smalltalk has many dialects, some that I would highlight are:

- [Pharo Smalltalk](http://pharo.org) - A full-fledged dialect with a full fledge IDE. [A selling point of Smalltalk is Live-Coding IDE](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-learning-Smalltalk-without-an-IDE). Also, the most popular Smalltalk.
- [GNU Smalltalk](https://www.gnu.org/software/smalltalk/manual/html_node/Tutorial.html) - A Smalltalk dialect that can run as a script, and has a REPL -- so, works well with VS Code.
- Another two dialects that come to my eyes at this point are [Squeak Smalltalk](https://squeak.org) and [Dolphin Smalltalk](http://www.object-arts.com/dolphin7.html). I think Dolphin is based on Windows, and Squeak has some tutorials lying around, also for MacOS. (I am using MacOS.)

## So, I started learning with GNU Smalltalk

So, I see a little how scripts work in a filesystem, minimalistically. I try running it in Terminal in VS Code.

## What about Pharo Smalltalk

When I started trying to do something real (web scraping), I noticed that some functions in GNU Smalltalk and Pharo are different... So, I might have to stick with one for the time being. I chose Pharo, and chose to learn Pharo IDE as well.

## Test Driven Development

I find this helpful to getting started. -- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOuZyOKa91o>

## Git Integration

Of course, I manage to get this working, using <https://github.com/pharo-vcs/iceberg>. It is a part of Pharo IDE, albeit a little hidden in 6.1 version. In 7.0rc, it is quite clear. Many bugs, though.

Another option is gitfiletree <https://www.peteruhnak.com/blog/2016/07/25/how-to-use-git-and-github-with-pharo/>.
